# Are you facing this problem ?
You have correct c++ code (accepted by coding platforms) which works properly. You have also written your own code but it is not accepted and you want to check/debug where your code fails or which testcase is failed, Then this might be helpful.

# Before using you need this ...
- g++ comipler
- windows terminal

# How to use this ?
- First Copy correct(accepted) code to `correct.cpp`
- Write `testcases.cpp` which generates proper testcases
- Write your code in `check.cpp` that you want to test(debug).
- Open Terminal and write : `check`
